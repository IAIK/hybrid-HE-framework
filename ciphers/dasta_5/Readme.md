# DASTA-5

Bitsliced implementation of DASTA with a statesize of 525 bits and 5 rounds providing 128 bit security.

Homomorphic matrix multiplications are optimized using the methods of the 4 russians.

We thank the authors of [Dasta](https://tosc.iacr.org/index.php/ToSC/article/view/8696/8288) for providing us with their source code, which we used as a starting point for our implementation.
